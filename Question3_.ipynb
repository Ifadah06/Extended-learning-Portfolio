The parse() method is used to look at the material that has been downloaded and pull out the title and text.\n",

The process of extracting information is wrapped in a try-except block in the extract_article_info function. Suppose something goes wrong, like a NewspaperException or a urllib. Error.URLError, the except block will catch it. A message that says there was a problem getting the story from the URL is printed in the except block. When the extraction fails, the method returns None.\n",

The download downloads the article's information () function in the Article class if there is a problem with the network, like urllib. Error.URLError or requests. Exceptions.RequestException, they can be caught in the try-except part of the extract_article_info function. In the same way that invalid URLs are handled, an error message is shown, and the method returns None to show that the extraction failed.\n"
